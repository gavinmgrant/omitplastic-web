## 🛍️ Start with the Easiest Wins

When you're just getting started, focus on replacing items you use **every day**. These build quick momentum and reduce a surprising amount of waste.

### ✔ Bring Your Own Reusable Bags  
Plastic [shopping bags](https://www.omitplastic.com/products?category=shopping-bags) are one of the most common sources of household plastic waste. Swapping to reusable bags is one of the simplest and most effective changes.

> *Tip: keep 2–3 in your car or by the door so you never forget them.*

### ✔ Switch to a Reusable Water Bottle  
Plastic water [bottles](https://www.omitplastic.com/products?category=bottles) are a massive contributor to pollution. A single high-quality stainless steel or glass bottle can replace hundreds of disposable ones each year.

## 🍽️ Reduce Plastic in Your Kitchen (The Biggest Impact Area)

The [kitchen](https://www.omitplastic.com/products?category=food-kitchen) is where most households use the most plastic — from food packaging to cleaning products. You don't need to overhaul your entire kitchen. Focus on 4 major swap categories:

### **Swap #1 — Food Storage & Wraps**  
Replace plastic wrap, sandwich bags, and disposable containers with reusable alternatives.

Common beginner-friendly options include:  
- Beeswax wraps  
- Silicone snack bags  
- Glass or stainless steel containers  
- Compostable food bags  

### **Swap #2 — Sustainable Cleaning Supplies**  
Many cleaning sprays, detergents, and dish soaps are packaged in disposable plastic. Switching to plastic-free or refillable formats reduces long-term waste dramatically.

### **Swap #3 — Choose Plastic-Free Paper Goods**  
Paper towels, toilet paper, and tissues often come wrapped in plastic. Compostable or fully plastic-free alternatives make an immediate impact.

## 🧼 Go Plastic-Free in the Bathroom (Small Changes, Big Impact)

Bathrooms are filled with plastic bottles — shampoo, conditioner, body wash, toothpaste, razors… and most aren't recyclable.

Here are gentle beginner swaps that require little effort:

### **Swap #1 — Solid Shampoo & Conditioner Bars**  
These eliminate plastic bottles entirely, last longer than liquid products, and are travel-friendly.

### **Swap #2 — Soaps & Skincare Without Plastic Packaging**  
Look for bar soaps, refillable skincare, or products wrapped in compostable or reusable materials.

### **Swap #3 — Compostable Cotton Swabs, Toothbrushes & Floss**  
Small items add up quickly. Bamboo toothbrushes and compostable floss are simple, low-commitment swaps.

- Natural grooming products

## ♻️ Build Habits That Stick

Going plastic-free is more about building good habits than perfection. Start with small, repeatable behaviors:

### ✔ Keep a reusable kit handy  
A few items you use often:

- A reusable water bottle  
- A reusable bag  
- A travel utensil set  
- A reusable coffee cup  

Store them in your car or backpack — they'll prevent most unexpected single-use plastics.

### ✔ Choose products with plastic-free packaging  
Once you start looking closely, you'll find many products with recyclable, compostable, or reusable packaging.

### ✔ Buy higher-quality, longer-lasting items  
Durability reduces long-term waste and saves money over time.

### ✔ Start with ONE room  
Trying to eliminate plastic everywhere can be overwhelming. Instead:

1. Start in your **kitchen**  
2. Then your **bathroom**  
3. Then **cleaning supplies**  
4. Then **shopping & on-the-go items**

Small steps compound quickly.
